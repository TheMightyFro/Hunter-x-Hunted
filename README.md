Hunter x Hunted

A fast-paced local-multiplayer chase game built in Python using Pygame.

Hunter x Hunted is a competitive split-role arena game where one player becomes the Hunter and the other becomes the Hunted. Outmaneuver, outpace, and outsmart your opponent as roles reverse, timers tick down, and the arena fills with obstacles, effects, and power-ups. Designed for quick rounds, high replayability, and couch multiplayer fun.
